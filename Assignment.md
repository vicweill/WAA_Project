# Web Application Architectures Project 2021


Choose the Assignement you prefer. You don't need to make them all, they can be done separately. Your maximum score for each Assignement is given. The more you do, the more points you can get.

This document is still a Draft, I will add new assignements, and I may modify some parts.



**NO VERY EASY TO FIND BUGS**
This goes without saying, features must work well, with no easy to find bug. I must be able to change user without problems and without the need to reload the page, if it's a multiuser app  (I will test it using multiple usernames.)
==> TEST YOUR APP BEFORE RELEASING IT


**Available on a public web url**
Apps must be available on a public web url. 

Use Heroku, Azure, GCP, AWS, or any other service. You can also host it yourself, but the server must be up when I will review your work.

**Publish all code on github**
Create one repository that will contain all your assignements
Inside this repository Create one directory by assignement.
The directory name must start with the Assignement number.
YOU WILL RECEIVE NO SCORE IF YOU DON'T RESPECT THE IMPOSED DIRECTORY NAME AND FILE STRUCTURE.

**Write your own code**
A code plagiarism checker will be used. Students with too similar code will receive less points.
I invite you to work together, to ask for help and help your classmates.
I also invite you to never transmit full snippets of your project code.


## Assignement 1 : Static html + js. 5 points** 
Starting from the live multiuser whiteboard drawing app, add the following feature

- Add a button in the menubar to open image in a new tab. the opened image will be static, and can be saved by the user using right click | save image as. 

use canvas.toDataURL() method

ONLY 2 FILES in the assignement directory 
index.html, index.js

## Assignement 2 : Node.js. 10 points** 
Starting from the live multiuser whiteboard drawing app, add the save image on server feature :


- Create a new endpoint on your node server able to receive http post file uploads.
File upload will be stored in a dedicated folder. Watch out for directory permissions
Whenever a file is uploaded, insert a document in a mongodb database with username, datetime, path to image.


use canvas.toDataURL() method

- On client side, Add a button in the menubar to save the image on the server.
- use Fetch to send the image stored in the DataURL to the new endpoint.
- Display a sucess message on client when upload is done.


- Create a new endpoint on your node server to send the list of uploaded images with username, datetime, URL to image
- Add a "saved images" button in the menubar that will open a new page listing all saved images with links to open them.


you can use the "Formidable" Node Module to handle file uploads :
https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_uploadfiles.asp
https://www.npmjs.com/package/formidable


The assignement directory will contain your node.js file structure including
server.js ( your main node code)
package.json
a public directory including your static files

NEVER UPLOAD node_modules directory to github, modules will be downloaded by npm start from package.json
